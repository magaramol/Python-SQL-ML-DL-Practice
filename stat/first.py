### **Conceptual Questions**  
1. What is a probability distribution? Can you differentiate between discrete and continuous probability distributions?  
it is outcome rv expt along with its probabliyic values;

dicreste  are distinct values of random variable such as coin toss
continius in values are in range 


2. Explain the differences between a probability density function (PDF) and a cumulative distribution function (CDF).  

pdf is function that describe likelihood of a continus random variable within specific range
cdf is sum of pdf


3. What is the difference between a uniform distribution and a normal distribution? Provide use cases for each.  

uniform distrubution are having value same for each x pint, ex dice rolling .
while there are diffrent values of normal distrubution bell shaped peak at mean centred at mean
ex adult height



4. Define and differentiate between a Binomial distribution and a Poisson distribution. When would you use one over the other?  





5. Explain the concept of the Central Limit Theorem and its significance in data science. 

clt it is important therom in maths and stat it basically teel us that if we have sample size ore than 30 then 
of any distrubution need not be gausian then mean of \
    random sampled datapoint will be following normal distrubution


### **Practical Application Questions**  
6. How would you verify if a dataset follows a normal distribution? Name some statistical tests and visualization techniques.  


QQ plot 


7. Suppose you have a dataset with skewed data. What probability distribution might model it better, and how would you transform it into a normal distribution?  

log normal , box cox transformation

8. How can probability distributions be used to model uncertainty in machine learning predictions?  

### **Real-world Problem Solving**  
9. In a call center, you observe that the number of calls received per minute is highly variable.
 Which probability distribution would you use to model the number of calls, and why?  




10. If an e-commerce site experiences 10 purchases per hour on average, what is the probability of observing exactly 15 purchases in an hour? Which distribution would you use to calculate this?  

### **Coding/Implementation**  
11. Write Python code to generate 1000 samples from a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Plot its histogram.  




12. Given a dataset of customer waiting times, write Python code to fit an exponential distribution and estimate its parameters.  





13. How would you simulate data from a binomial distribution in Python for an experiment with 20 trials and a success probability of 0.7?  

### **Advanced Questions**  
14. Explain the concept of a joint probability distribution and how it differs from marginal and conditional distributions.  




15. Discuss the concept of entropy in probability distributions. How is it relevant to data science?  




16. What is a multivariate normal distribution, and how is it applied in machine learning models?
